  Rules:

    The Deck and Scoring:

      You are dealt cards from a 52-card deck consisting of Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades.

      The suits each have 13 values: 2 through 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace.

      2 through 10 are worth their face values.

      Jack, Queen, and King are each worth 10.

      The Ace is worth 11, or worth 1 if counting it as 11 would cause the total to exceed 21.

    Game Play:

      You are facing an opponent, the dealer. Both you and the dealer are initially dealt 2 cards.

      You can see the 2 cards you have been dealt, but can only see one of the dealer's cards.

      On your turn, you can choose to either "hit" (be dealt another card) or "Stay" (keep your hand and move on to the dealer's turn).

    Winning:

      The goal of Twenty-One is to try to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over.

      You win the round either if you have a higher total than the dealer without "busting", or if the dealer busts.

      If you go over 21, it's a "bust" and you lose!

      If the dealer goes over 21, they "bust" and you win!

      Win five rounds in this match to become the Grand Winner!
